## What is EZcrypt?

EZcrypt is a simple file encryption tool. It is intended to be used with FileHider and Abyss Dropper and other tools for a security project I'm working on. EZcrypt is a work in progress. And although it's intended to be used for a very specific security project, it can also be used more generally for file encryption and decryption.

EZcrypt is made in Java and JavaFX. It uses Blowfish encryption to encrypt files. It also uses the Apache Commons IO library for converting files to byte streams and vice versa. 

## JAR

If you want to download the standalone .JAR file (the easiest way to run this program), instead of dealing with source code files, then download it from [here](https://github.com/0x416c616e/ezcrypt/raw/master/out/artifacts/ezc_new123_jar2/ezc_new123.jar). It requires Java to run.
