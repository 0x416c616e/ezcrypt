# EZcrypt

##What is EZcrypt?

EZcrypt is a simple file encryption tool. It is intended to be used with FileHider and Abyss Dropper and other tools for a security project I'm working on. EZcrypt is a work in progress. And although it's intended to be used for a very specific security project, it can also be used more generally for file encryption and decryption.

EZcrypt is made in Java and JavaFX. It uses Blowfish encryption to encrypt files. It also uses the Apache Commons IO library for converting files to byte streams and vice versa. 

##Why not just use bcrypt?

You're right, this is functionally the same as using bcrypt. However, this is graphical, which is more user-friendly, and it's also a good learning experience with programming. Sometimes, adding a better UX is important, even if the program itself seems somewhat derivative. And it's also a good way to learn more about how encryption works.
